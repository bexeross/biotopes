Currently thinking of two different approaches, one using the classified points as the main element, another one using the species data.
Different approach means different defition/set of rules for declaring VMEs!

# Approach 1.- Using the biotope classification

Requires: my.subs.small, trimmedwide, indsp, indval

## Input data and libraries
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(rgdal)
library(indicspecies)

clname = "SubTmpMrgS6"
level = "level7"

hab_sub <- my.subs.small %>%
  filter(class==clname)%>%
  select(contains(level))%>%
  pull()

spe_sub <- trimmedwide %>%
  left_join(my.subs.small)%>%
  filter(class==clname)%>%
  #ungroup()%>%
  select(all_of(indsp))

spe_sub_nude <- spe_sub %>% ungroup() %>% select(-SampID)


```
