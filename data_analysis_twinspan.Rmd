## Libraries
```{r}
library(twinspan)
library(tidyr)
```


## Make the matrix into wide format
```{r}
trimmedwide <- trimmed %>% select(-c(TotAbu,clean_taxonomy)) %>%
  mutate(new_name = gsub(" ","",new_name)) %>%
  mutate(new_name = gsub("\\.","",new_name)) %>%
  mutate(new_name = tolower(new_name)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = new_name, values_from = density_n_100m2, values_fill = 0, values_fn = sum)

head(trimmedwide)
```
